[Project]

Objective: Accurately predict the stocks which yields the most using models and AI.

Methods: 
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, SciKit-Learn, TensorFlow
Data Source: Yahoo Finance Financial Statements

Steps:
1. Gather financial data on stocks
2. Gather pricing information for dependent variable
3. Pre-process and clean the data
4. Choose a model: Logistic Regression (most likely)
5. Train Model
6. Evaluation: using rmse (find other ways)
7. Parameter Tuning: Check for overfitting and underfitting (basically the alpha part of the house price predictions)
8. Prediction (final result)
